        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            I've been making this fondue since the early '70s. 
            This recipe uses two types of cheese and always turns out super smooth. 
            I like to serve it with cubes of crusty bread 
            for dipping, but baby potatoes, bell peppers, and sliced apples also work 
            great!
        </p>
